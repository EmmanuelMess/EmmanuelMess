# Hi! I'm Emmanuel
Student, and working on projects. I speak native Spanish and fluent English.
I usually time-limit my projects to about a week or two.

## Knowledge

### General
I know [Java](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java&sort=), [Kotlin](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=kotlin&sort=stargazers), [C](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c&sort=stargazers), some [C++](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%2B%2B&sort=stargazers), and [Python](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python&sort=stargazers). Also, for school, not much to show, but I know Haskell, [Erlang](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=erlang&sort=stargazers), and Standard ML.

### Not so general

I have a strong background on computer science, studying at [FCEIA](https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/). I have an intuitive understanding of Linear Algebra, and know how neural networks, transformers, GANs and other things that iteratively learn work, but don't have much expirience with hyperparameter optimization.

On the machine learning side I know how Tensorflow and Pytorch work, but haven't done extensive long term work with those. I have a [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/emmanuelmess). 

Most of my expirience is with Android, [here](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Android&type=&language=&sort=) are my Android repos. I have worked with Flutter and Xamarin on Android. Generally prefering Flutter. I know how to interface C/C++ with Android.

I know how game math works, and have created [a few small games](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Game&type=&language=&sort=), I have worked with Unity, Godot, LibGdx (Java/Kotlin), Ogre (C++). 

Also know my way around JHipster and work well with git.

Networking was taught to me, and I know how some things work, OSI, TCP/IP, UDP, etc. but my knowledge is very limited, and I find difficult to understand the complexities of large scale reliability on high demand.

I use Ubuntu to work.
