# Hi! I'm Emmanuel
I study computer science, I am a developer in agrotech, and I work on small projects. Spanish is my native language, I am fluent in English and I am studying Chinese.
I code small projects that are time-limited to about a week or two.

## Knowledge
### General
I know [Java](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java&sort=), [Kotlin](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=kotlin&sort=stargazers), [C](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c&sort=stargazers), [C++](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%2B%2B&sort=stargazers), [Python](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python&sort=stargazers) and some [CUDA C++](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=cuda&sort=stargazers). Also, for school, I have coded in [Haskell](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=haskell&sort=stargazers), [Erlang](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=erlang&sort=stargazers), and Standard ML. I know how to work with [Arduinos](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Arduino&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers) and NVIDIA embedded devices (TX2, Orin, etc.), and took classes on electronics. I know how to use [MATLAB](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=matlab&sort=stargazers), Scilab and other similar math tools.

I have experience working on AI for agrotech, running detection in real-time on specialized embedded devices (AI on the edge).

### Not so general

I have a strong background on computer science, studying at [FCEIA](https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/). I have an intuitive understanding of linear algebra, and know how neural networks, transformers, GANs and other things that iteratively learn work, but don't have much experience with hyperparameter optimization.

On the machine learning side have worked with Caffe, Tensorflow and PyTorch. I have a [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/emmanuelmess). For a private agrotech company I am doing work on classification, for embedded systems, doing realtime detection of undergrowth in crops.

Most of my experience is with Android, [here](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Android&type=&language=&sort=) are my Android repos. I have worked with Flutter and Xamarin on Android but I prefer Flutter for most work. I know how to interface C/C++ with Android.

I work with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and [ROS 2](https://github.com/ros2) both with C++ and Python, coding apps that do realtime processing of multiple inputs with inference on embedded NVIDIA devices using CUDA and TensorRT. 

I know how game math works, and have created [a few small games](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Game&type=&language=&sort=), I have worked with Unity, Godot, LibGdx (Java/Kotlin), Ogre (C++). 

Also know my way around JHipster framework and I am proficient using git.

Computer networking was taught to me but my knowledge is very limited (OSI, TCP/IP, UDP, IPv4, IPv6, DHCP, ICMP, etc.), and I struggle to understand the complexities of large scale reliability on high demand.

I use Ubuntu in my everyday life and I am somewhat familiar with how it works.
