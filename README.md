# Hi! I'm Emmanuel
Student of computer science, developer in agrotec, and working on projects. I speak native Spanish and fluent English.
I code small projects that I usually time-limit to about a week or two.

## Knowledge

### General
I know [Java](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java&sort=), [Kotlin](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=kotlin&sort=stargazers), [C](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c&sort=stargazers), [C++](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%2B%2B&sort=stargazers), [Python](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python&sort=stargazers) and some [CUDA C++](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=cuda&sort=stargazers). Also, for school, not much to show, but I know [Haskell](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=haskell&sort=stargazers), [Erlang](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=erlang&sort=stargazers), and Standard ML. I know how to work with [Arduinos](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Arduino&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers) and Nvidia embedded devices (TX2, Orin, etc.), and took classes on electronics. I know how to use [MATLAB](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=matlab&sort=stargazers), Scilab and other similar maths tools.

I have expirience working on AI for agrotech, running detection on realtime on specialized embedded devices (AI on the edge).

### Not so general

I have a strong background on computer science, studying at [FCEIA](https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/). I have an intuitive understanding of Linear Algebra, and know how neural networks, transformers, GANs and other things that iteratively learn work, but don't have much expirience with hyperparameter optimization.

On the machine learning side have worked with Caffe, Tensorflow and Pytorch. I have a [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/emmanuelmess). On the private side, I am doing work on classification, for embedded systems, detecting undergrowth.

Most of my expirience is with Android, [here](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Android&type=&language=&sort=) are my Android repos. I have worked with Flutter and Xamarin on Android. Generally prefering Flutter. I know how to interface C/C++ with Android.

I work with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and [ROS 2](https://github.com/ros2) both with C++ and Python, coding apps that do realtime processing of mutliple inputs with inference on embedded NVIDIA devices that with CUDA and TensorRT. 

I know how game math works, and have created [a few small games](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Game&type=&language=&sort=), I have worked with Unity, Godot, LibGdx (Java/Kotlin), Ogre (C++). 

Also know my way around JHipster and work well with git.

Networking was taught to me, and I know how some things work, OSI, TCP/IP, UDP, IPv4, IPv6,v DHCP, ICMP, etc. but my knowledge is very limited, and I find difficult to understand the complexities of large scale reliability on high demand.

I use Ubuntu.
