# Hi! I'm Emmanuel

I'm finishing my computer science graduate thesis. I'm a developer in multiple FOSS projects, worked at agrotech, and I currently work on small projects. Spanish is my native language, I am fluent in English and I am studying Chinese.

## Knowledge
### General knowledge
- Languages (click to see my work on that language): [Java](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java&sort=), [Kotlin](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=kotlin&sort=stargazers), [C](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c&sort=stargazers), [C++](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%2B%2B&sort=stargazers), [Python](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python&sort=stargazers), and some [CUDA C++](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=cuda&sort=stargazers) and [OpenCL C](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=opencl&type=&sort=stargazers). Also, for school, I have coded in [Haskell](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=haskell&sort=stargazers), [Erlang](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=erlang&sort=stargazers), and Standard ML.
- Embedded devices: [Arduinos](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Arduino&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers), NVIDIA embedded devices (TX2, Orin, etc.), and took classes on simple electronic systems
- Machine learning: See my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/emmanuelmess), and I also have experience working on AI for agrotech, running detection in real-time on specialized embedded devices (AI on the edge).
- Robotics: I know how to use ROS and ROS2, along with learning how the [Gazebo](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=gazebo&type=&language=&sort=stargazers) simulator works. Along with learning the mathematics of SLAM and making many contributions to the repos of Open Robotics and many other smaller ones.
- Satellites: I know how GPS (and GNSS) works from the satellite orbit to the receiver interference, and I made two GNSS simulators: [one in python](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess/GNSS-Simulator) and one as a gazebo plugin (private for now).
- 3D printing: A mechanical engineer and I made a 4 axis 3d printer, called [Core R-Theta 4 Axis Printer](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess/Core-R-Theta-4-Axis-Printer-UNR-Improvements), along with a UI for its software called [NonPlanarSlicingDeformation](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess/NonPlanarSlicingDeformation), and an adaptation to be able to run the 12860 screen with a 4th axis [Core R-Theta Menu System](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess/CoreRThetaMenuSystem).
- And other tools: [MATLAB](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=matlab&sort=stargazers), Scilab and other similar math environments.

### Not so general

I have a strong background on computer science, studying licenciature in computer science at [FCEIA](https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/). I have an intuitive understanding of linear algebra, and know how neural networks, transformers, GANs and other similar systems work.

On the machine learning side have worked with Caffe, Tensorflow and PyTorch, see my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/emmanuelmess). For a private agrotech company I did work on classification, using embedded systems to do realtime detection of undergrowth in crops.

I have a lot of expirience with Android, [here](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Android&type=&language=&sort=) are my Android repos. I have also worked with Flutter and Xamarin for Android. I know how to interface C/C++ with Android using the JNI and NDK.

I work with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and [ROS 2](https://github.com/ros2) both with C++ and Python, coding apps that do realtime processing of multiple inputs with inference on embedded NVIDIA devices using CUDA and TensorRT. 

I know how game math works, and have created [a few small games](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess?tab=repositories&q=Game&type=&language=&sort=), I have worked with Unity, Godot, LibGdx (in Java or Kotlin), Ogre (in C++), and Raylib (in C, Python and Rust). 

I worked on the builing of a [4 axis 3D printer](https://github.com/jyjblrd/Core-R-Theta-4-Axis-Printer/discussions/59) at [Rosario National University FCEIA's maker space](https://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/espaciomaker/), and created [software for it](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess/NonPlanarSlicingDeformation). 


I use Ubuntu in my everyday life and I am familiar with how it works.
